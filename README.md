**Handwritten Character Recognition**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten characters from images. The system is trained to classify characters, providing accurate predictions for a given dataset.

**Project Overview**
Handwritten Character Recognition is a popular task in the field of computer vision, where the goal is to classify characters from handwritten text. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to automate the identification of individual characters.

**Features**
Preprocessing: Images are preprocessed using techniques like resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization.
Model: A deep learning model (e.g., CNN) is trained on a labeled dataset of handwritten characters.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Prediction: The system predicts the character based on the input image of handwritten text.
**Technologies Used**
Python
NumPy - for array manipulation
Pandas - for dataset handling
Matplotlib/Seaborn - for data visualization
TensorFlow/Keras - for model creation and training
OpenCV - for image processing
Dataset
The dataset used consists of images of handwritten characters. Each image is labeled with the corresponding character. It includes both upper and lower case English alphabets, digits, and possibly special symbols.

**Results**
The model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set. Below is an example of its performance:

Input: Handwritten Image
Output: Predicted Character
